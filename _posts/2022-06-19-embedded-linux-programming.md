# Embedded Linux Programming

## Introduction

Four elements of embedded Linux:

  * Toolchain - contains the compiler and other tools;
  * Bootloader - the program that initializes the board and loads the Linux kernel;
  * Kernel - managing system resources and interfacing with hardware
  * Root filesystem - the libraries and programs

The most often used architectures:
  * ARM
  * MIPS
  * PowerPC
  * x86
